# Lead Extraction Scripts

This directory contains scripts to extract business names and email addresses from JSON lead files and convert them to CSV format for easy import into CRM systems or email marketing tools.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Run the Bash Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root directory
cd /Users/calebbenedict/SavantUniversalLandingPage

# Run the extraction script
./scripts/extract-leads.sh
```

### Option 2: Run the Node.js Script Directly
```bash
# From the project root directory
node scripts/extract-leads.js
```

## üìÅ What Gets Created

The script processes all JSON files in the `leads/` directory and creates:

### Individual CSV Files
- `accounting-firm-leads.csv` (591 leads)
- `auto-repair-leads.csv` (612 leads)
- `dentist-leads.csv` (628 leads)
- `hvac-leads.csv` (550 leads)
- ... and 21 more verticals

### Combined CSV File
- `all-leads-combined.csv` (15,968 total leads) - Contains all leads with a vertical column

- `business_name` - The business name (from location_name or business_name fields)

- `phone` - Primary phone number (optional)
- `website` - Business website URL (optional)
